My Portfolio

This site was built from scratch using HTML5, CSS3. The project was completed in VScode using the Node.js library node-sass to compile SCSS to CSS.
Design was aimed at providing a clean, minimal UI with all CSS animations using the same accent colors.
The small piece of Javascript in the project is taken directly from a Youtube tutorial.
